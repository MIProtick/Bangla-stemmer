# Fatick Stemmer
## Description
<!--
&nbsp; is for one char space and
&emsp; is for one tab space
-->
Bengali is one of the most morphologically rich languages and it has lots of inflectional and derivational variant forms of a word. Because of that it is quite complicated to determine the stem of word.

Therefore our main focus was to program a light-weight library to determine a identical word for same type of inflected word as stem to run on any model.
